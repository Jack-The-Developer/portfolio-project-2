        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>I used to be a truck driver. I have been 
        to  48 states out of 50. I decided to change 
        careers and have re-enrolled in college to
        order to further my education.</p>

        trees."/>
        
        <p>Thanks to everyone at <a href = 
        "https://www.thinkful.com/"> Thankful</a>, I 
        have begun to learn a new skill set and look 
        forward to working on learning more.</p>
        
        <p>If you ever need extra hands on a project, 
        I'd love to help and gain some more 
        experience. A win-win situation!</p>
      
        <p>I'm excited to learn more about Web Development! It's getting   
        increasingly more important to have a digital footprint as time goes on. 
        Being able to help myself and those around me in that pursuit will be 
        rewarding. I can't wait to start working with other developers on more 
        complex projects! I'm also interested in traveling as well as gaining new 
        skills and experiences. Becoming a more complete person is my ultimate 
        goal. </p>
